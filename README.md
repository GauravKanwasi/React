# Resume Builder

This project is a Resume Builder application that allows you to create professional resumes quickly and easily. It was bootstrapped using Create React App.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Starts the app in development mode. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application. The page will reload automatically when you make changes, and any lint errors will be shown in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Use this command to run tests and ensure that your application functions as expected.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder. This command bundles the React application in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include unique hashes, ensuring your app is ready to be deployed.

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you run `eject`, you cannot revert back. This command copies all configuration files and dependencies (such as webpack, Babel, and ESLint) into your project so you have full control over them. Use this only if you need to customize the build process beyond what Create React App offers.
